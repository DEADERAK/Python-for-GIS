# Python-for-GIS
Real estate prices (and their median values) have long been considered important indicators of a region's economic status. On the other hand, the number of crimes in a region often correlates with the local economy. Therefore, a very natural question to consider is : whether there is a direct relationship between the median real estate prices in an area and the local crime rate ?
This GitHub repository includes all the data for this project, including the two basic CSV source data files, the clipped example area LSOA.shp file, and a Jupyter notebook encompassing all the analyses of the project.
The code in the notebook aims to analyze and elucidate the potential relationship between the median real estate prices and the number of crimes in Leeds during the specified month. It will ultimately generate two visualization charts to support the conclusions drawn from the analysis.
